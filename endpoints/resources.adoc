You can access the resources provided through the Astra Control REST API to automate an Astra deployment. Each resource is available through one or more endpoints. An introduction to the REST resources you can use as part of an automation deployment is provided below.

[NOTE]
The format of the path and full URL used to access the Astra Control resources is based on several values. See link:../rest-core/url_format.html[URL format] for more information. Also see link:../get-started/online_api_ref.html[Online API reference] for more details about using the Astra resources and endpoints.

== Summary of Astra Control REST resources

The primary resource endpoints provided in the Astra Control REST API are organized in three categories. Each resource can be accessed with the full set of CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) except where noted.

The *Release* column indicates the Astra release when the resource was first introduced. This field is bolded for the resources most recently added to the REST API.

=== Core resources

The core resource endpoints provide the foundational services needed to establish and maintain the Astra runtime environment.
