[.lead]
You can create a new application by cloning an existing app.

=== Before you begin

Note the following about this workflow:

* An app backup or snapshot is not used
* The clone operation is performed within the same cluster
* The new app is placed in a different namespace

[NOTE]
To clone an app to a different cluster, you need to update the `clusterId` parameter in the JSON input as appropriate for your environment.

=== 1. Select the app to clone

Perform the workflow link:wf_list_man_apps.html[List the apps] and select application you want to clone. Several of the resource values are needed for the REST call used to clone the app.

=== 2. Clone the app

Perform the following REST API call to clone the app.

[cols="25,75"*,options="header"]

|HTTP method
|Path
|POST
|/accounts/{account_id}/k8s/v2/apps

===== Additional input parameters
