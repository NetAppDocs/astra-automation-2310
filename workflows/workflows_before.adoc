[.lead]
You can use these workflows as part of administering the applications in an Astra managed cluster.

[NOTE]
These workflows can be expanded and enhanced by NetApp at any time and so you should review them periodically.

== General preparation

Before using any of the Astra workflows, make sure to review link:../get-started/prepare_to_use_workflows.html[Prepare to use the workflows].

== Workflow categories

The management workflows are organized in different categories to make it easier to locate the one you want.

|Category
|Description
|Application control
|These workflows allow you to control the managed and unmanaged applications. You can list the apps as well as create and remove a managed app.
|Application protection
|You can use these workflows to protect your managed applications through snapshots and backups.
|Cloning and restoring apps
|These workflow describe how to clone and restore your managed applications.
|Support
|There are several workflows available to debug and support your applications as well as the general Kubernetes environment.

== Additional considerations

There are a several additional considerations when using the management workflows.

=== Cloning an app

There are a few things to consider when cloning an application. The parameters described below are part of the JSON input.

Source cluster identifier::
The value of `sourceClusterID` always identifies the cluster where the original app is installed.

Cluster identifier::
The value of `clusterID` identifies the cluster where the new app will be installed.

* When cloning within the same cluster, `clusterID` and `sourceClusterID` have the same value.
* When cloning across clusters, the two values are different and `clusterID` should be the ID of the target cluster.

Namespaces::
The `namespace` value must be different than the original source app. Further, the namespace for the clone cannot exist and Astra will create it.

Backups and snapshots::
You can optionally clone an application from an existing backup or snapshot using the `backupID` or `snapshotID` parameters. If you don't provide a backup or snapshot, Astra will create a backup of the application first and then clone from the backup.

==== Restoring an app

Here are a few things to consider when restoring an application.

* Restoring an application is very similar to the clone operation.
* When restoring an app, you must provide either a backup or snapshot.
