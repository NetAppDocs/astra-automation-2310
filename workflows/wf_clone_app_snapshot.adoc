You can create a new application by cloning it from a snapshot.

=== Before you begin

Note the following about this workflow:

* An app snapshot is used
* The clone operation is performed within the same cluster

[NOTE]
To clone an app to a different cluster, you need to update the `clusterId` parameter in the JSON input as appropriate for your environment.

=== 1. Select the app to clone

Perform the workflow link:wf_list_man_apps.html[List the apps] and select application you want to clone. Several of the resource values are needed for the REST call used to clone the app.

=== 2. Select the snapshot to use

Perform the workflow link:wf_list_snapshots.html[List the snapshots] and select snapshot you want to use.

=== 3. Clone the app

Perform the following REST API call.

[cols="25,75"*,options="header"]

|/accounts/{account_id}/k8s/v2/apps
