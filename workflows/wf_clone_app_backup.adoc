You can create a new application by cloning it from a backup.

=== Before you begin

Note the following about this workflow:

* An app backup is used
* The clone operation is performed within the same cluster

[NOTE]
To clone an app to a different cluster, you need to update the `clusterId` parameter in the JSON input as appropriate for your environment.

=== 1. Select the app to clone

Perform the workflow link:wf_list_man_apps.html[List the apps] and select application you want to clone. Several of the resource values are needed for the REST call used to clone the app.

=== 2. Select the backup to use

Perform the workflow link:wf_list_backups.html[List the backups] and select backup you want to use.

=== 3. Clone the app

Perform the following REST API call.
