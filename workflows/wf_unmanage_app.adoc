You can remove a managed app when it's no longer needed. Removing a managed application also deletes the associated schedules.

=== Before you begin

You must have the ID of the app you want to unmanage. If needed you can use the workflow link:wf_list_man_apps.html[List the apps] to locate the application.

The application's backups and snapshots are not automatically removed when it is deleted. If you no longer need the backups and snapshots, you should delete them before removing the application.

=== 1. Unmanaged the app

Perform the following REST API call to remove the app.

[cols="25,75"*,options="header"]
|===
|HTTP method
|Path
|DELETE
|/accounts/{account_id}/k8s/v2/apps/{app_id}
|===

===== Additional input parameters

In addition to the parameters common with all REST API calls, the following parameters are also used in the curl examples for this step.

[cols="25,10,10,55"*,options="header"]
|===
|Parameter
|Type

|Description
