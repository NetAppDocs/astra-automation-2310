The Astra Control REST API provides several different ways to access resource collections through the defined query parameters.

.Selecting values

You can specify which key-value pairs should be returned for each resource instance using the `include` parameter. All of the instances are returned in the response body.

.Filtering

Collection resource filtering allows an API user to specify conditions which determine if a resource is returned in the response body. The `filter` parameter is used to indicate the filtering condition.

.Sorting

Collection resource sorting allows an API user to specify the order in which resources are returned in the response body. The `orderBy` parameter is used to indicate the filtering condition.

.Pagination

You can enforce pagination by restricting the number of resource instances returned on a request using the `limit` parameter.

.Count

If you include the Boolean parameter `count` set to `true`, the number of resources in the returned array for a given response is provided in the metadata section.
