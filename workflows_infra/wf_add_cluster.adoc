[.lead]
You can add a cluster so it will be available to be managed by Astra. Beginning with the Astra 22.11 release, you can add a cluster with both Astra Control Center and Astra Control Service.

[NOTE]
Adding a cluster is not required when using a Kubernetes service from one of the major cloud providers (AKS, EKS, GKE).

=== 1. Obtain the kubeconfig file

You need to obtain a copy of the *kubconfig* file from your Kubernetes administrator or service.

=== 2. Prepare the kubeconfig file

Before using the *kubeconfig* file, you should perform the following operations:

.Convert file from YAML format to JSON
If you receive the kubeconfig file formatted as YAML, you need to convert it to JSON.

.Encode JSON in base64
You must encode the JSON file in base64.

.Example

Here is an example of converting the kubeconfig file from YAML to JSON and then encoding it in base64:

`yq -o=json ~/.kube/config | base64`

=== 3. Select the cloud

Perform the workflow link:../workflows_infra/wf_list_clouds.html[List the clouds] and select the cloud where the cluster will be added.

[NOTE]
The only cloud you can select is the *private* cloud.

=== 4. Create a credential

Perform the following REST API call to create a credential using the kubeconfig file.

[cols="25,75"*,options="header"]
|===
|HTTP method
|Path
|POST
|/accounts/{account_id}/core/v1/credentials
|===

===== JSON input example
[source,curl]
{
  "type" :  "application/astra-credential",
  "version" : "1.1",
  "name" : "Cloud One",
  "keyType" : "kubeconfig",
  "keyStore" : {
    "base64": encoded_kubeconfig
  },
  "valid" : "true"
}

===== Curl example
[source,curl]
curl --location -i --request POST 'https://astra.netapp.io/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/core/v1/credentials' --header 'Accept: */*' --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>' --data @JSONinput

=== 5. Add the cluster

Perform the following REST API call to add the cluster to the cloud. The value of the `credentialID` input field is obtained from the REST API call in the previous step.

[cols="25,75"*,options="header"]
|===
|HTTP method
|Path
|POST
|/accounts/{account_id}/topology/v1/clouds/{cloud_id}/clusters
|===

===== JSON input example
[source,curl]
{
  "type" :  "application/astra-cluster",
  "version" : "1.1",
  "credentialID": credential_id
}

===== Curl example
[source,curl]
curl --location -i --request POST 'https://astra.netapp.io/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/topology/v1/clouds/<CLOUD_ID>/clusters' --header 'Accept: */*' --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>' --data @JSONinput
