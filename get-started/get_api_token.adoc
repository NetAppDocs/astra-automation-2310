You need to obtain an Astra API token to use the Astra Control REST API.

== Overview

An API token identifies the caller to Astra and must be included with every REST API call.

* You need to generate an API token using the Astra web user interface.
* The procedure for generating a token is the same for both Astra deployment models. Only the URL used to access Astra is different.
* The user identity carried with the token and associated permissions are determined by the user that created the token.
* The token must be included in the `Authorization` HTTP request header.
* A token never expires after it is created.
* You can revoke a token at the Astra web user interface.
