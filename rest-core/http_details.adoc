[.lead]
The Astra Control REST API uses HTTP and related parameters to act on the resource instances and collections. Details of the HTTP implementation are presented below.

== API transactions and the CRUD model

The Astra Control REST API implements a transactional model with well-defined operations and state transitions.

.Request and response API transaction

Every REST API call is performed as an HTTP request to the Astra service. Each request generates an associated response back to the client. This request-response pair can be considered an API transaction.

.Support for CRUD operational model

Each of the resource instances and collections available through the Astra Control REST API is accessed based on the *CRUD* model. There are four operations, each of which maps to a single HTTP method. The operations include:

* Create
* Read
* Update
* Delete

For some of the Astra resources, only a subset of these operations is supported. You should review the link:../get-started/online_api_ref.html[Online API reference] for more information about a specific API call.

== HTTP methods

The HTTP methods or verbs supported by the API are presented in the table below.

[cols="15,15,70"*,options="header"]
|===
|Method
|CRUD
|Description

|GET
|Read
|Retrieves object properties for a resource instance or collection. This is considered a *list* operation when used with a collection.

|POST
|Create
|Creates a new resource instance based on the input parameters. The long-term URL is returned in a `Location` response header.

|PUT
|Update
|Updates an entire resource instance with the supplied JSON request body. Key values that are not user modifiable are preserved.

|DELETE
|Delete
|Deletes an existing resource instance.

|===

== Request and response headers

The following table summaries the HTTP headers used with the Astra Control REST API.

[NOTE]
See https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7232.txt[RFC 7232^] and https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7233.txt[RFC 7233^] for more information.

[cols="30,15,55"*,options="header"]
|===
|Header
|Type
|Usage notes

|Accept
|Request
|If the value is "*/*" or is not provided, `application/json` is returned in Content-Type response header. If the value is set to the Astra resource Media Type, the same Media Type is returned in the Content-Type header.

|Authorization
|Request
|Bearer token with the API key for the user.

|Content-Type
|Response
|Returned based on the `Accept` request header.

|Etag
|Response
|Included with a successful as defined with RFC 7232. The value is a hexadecimal representation of the MD5 value for the entire JSON resource.

|If-Match
|Request
|A precondition request header implemented as described in section 3.1 RFC 7232 and support for *PUT* requests.

|If-Modified-Since
|Request
|A precondition request header implemented as described in section 3.4 RFC 7232 and support for *PUT* requests.

|If-Unmodified-Since
|Request
|A precondition request header implemented as described in section 3.4 RFC 7232 and support for *PUT* requests.

|Location
|Response
|Contains the full URL of the newly created resource.

== Query parameters

The following query parameters are available for use with resource collections. See link:../additional/work_with_collections.html[Work with collections] for more information.
